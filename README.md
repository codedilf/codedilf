- 👋 Hi, I’m @codedilf
- 👀 I’m interested in Web and Software Development, Back-End Sytems including Data Analytics, and Machine Learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full-Stack Engineering via CodeCademy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most Web apps, mainly as a debugger as I find myself parsing through most code and finding issues and resolving them with relative speed.
- 📫 How to reach me: Message me on GitHub.
